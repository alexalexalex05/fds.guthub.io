            <h2 class="big">STATEMENT OF FAITH</h2>
            <h3 class="small"> 
               Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
               for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of
               God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. 2 Timothy 3:16-17
               
            </h3>
            <h2 class="big">Scriptures</h2>
            <p class="big">We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the Bible,
                as it is in truth, the Word of God… (I Thessalonians 2:13). We believe in verbal,
                plenary inspiration and God’s preservation of His pure words to every generation
                (II Timothy 3:16, Psalms 12:6-8). We believe that the King James Bible is the
                preserved Word of God, and as such is our sole authority for faith and practice.
            </p>
            <h2 class="big">The Godhead</h2>
            <p class="big"> believe in one Triune God, eternally existing in three persons–Father, Son, and
             Holy Spirit, co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory,
              and having the same attributes and perfections (Deuteronomy 6:4; II Corinthians 13:14).
            </p>
            <h2 class="big">Person and Work of Christ</h2>
            <p class="big"> believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, without ceasing
                to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, in order
                that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men (John 1:1-2, 14; Luke 1:35; Isaiah 9:6; 7:14;
               Philippians 2:5-8; Galatians 4:4-5).
            </p>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through His finished work on
                the cross as a representative, vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice; and that our justification
                is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead (Romans 3:24-25; I Peter 2:24;
                Ephesians 1:7; I Peter 1:3-5).
            </p>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to Heaven, and is now exalted at the right hand of God,
                where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate
                (Acts 1:9-10; Hebrews 9:24, 7:25; Romans 8:34; I John 2:1-2).
            </p>
            <h2 class="big">Person and Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that the Holy Spirit is the Person who reproves the world of sin, of righteousness, and of
                judgment; and that He is the Supernatural Agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body
                of Christ, indwelling and sealing them unto the day of redemption (John 16:8-11; II Corinthians 3:6;
                I Corinthians 12:12-14; Romans 8:9; Ephesians 1:13-14).
            </p>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that the sign gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues and the gift of healing,
                were temporary. We believe that speaking in tongues was never the common or necessary sign of the baptism
                or filling of the Holy Spirit and that ultimate deliverance of the body from sickness or death awaits the
                consummation of our salvation in the resurrection, though God frequently chooses to answer the prayer of
                believers for physical healing (II Corinthians 12:12; I Corinthians 13:8; Hebrews 2:3-4; Mark 16:17-20;
                I Corinthians 1:22, 14:21-22).
            </p>
            <h2 class="big">Man</h2>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God, but that in Adam’s sin the race fell,
                inherited a sinful nature, and became alienated from God; and that man is totally depraved, and, of himself,
                utterly unable to remedy his lost condition (Genesis 1:26-27; Romans 3:22-23; Ephesians 2:1-3, 12).
            </p>
            <p class="big">
                The sacredness of human personality is evident in that God created man in His own image and is mindful of
                him, and in that Christ died for man; therefore every individual possesses dignity and is worthy of
                respect and Christian love. (Psalm 8:4-9; Colossians 3:9-11).
            </p>
            <h2 class="big"> Way of Salvation</h2>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that the clear message of salvation is “repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus
                Christ” (Acts 20:21). We believe that salvation is “by grace” plus nothing minus nothing. We believe
                that men are justified by faith alone and are accounted righteous before God only through the merit
                of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. (Ephesians 2:8-10; John 1:12; I Peter 1:18-19)
            </p>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that all the redeemed, once saved are kept by God’s power and are thus secure in Christ forever.
                We believe that eternal life is the present possession of every believer (John 6:37-40, 10:27-30; Romans 8:1,
                38-39; I Corinthians 1:4-8; I Peter 1:4-5; Jude 1, 2).
            </p>
            <h2 class="big">Church</h2>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that the Church was established by Jesus Christ (Matthew 16), began on the day of Pentecost and was
                empowered by the Holy Spirit on that same day (Acts 2), and will be caught up to be with Christ at the Rapture.
                (Ephesians 1:22-23, 5:25-27; I Corinthians 12:12-14; II Corinthians 11:2).
            </p>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that the establishment and continuance of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New
                Testament Scriptures (Acts 14:27; 20:17, 28-32; I Timothy 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-11).
                We believe in the autonomy of the local church free of any external authority or control
                (Acts 13:1-4, 15:19-31, 20:28; Romans 16:1, 4; I Corinthians 3:9, 16, 5:4-7, 13; I Peter 5:1-4).
            </p>
            <h2 class="big">Ordinances of the Church</h2>
            <p class="big">
                We recognize the ordinances of baptism by immersion in water and the Lord’s Supper as a Scriptural means
                of testimony for the Church in this age (Matthew. 28:19-20; Acts 2:41-42, 18:18; I Corinthians 11:23-26).
            </p>
            <h2 class="big">Separation</h2>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that all the saved should live in such a manner as not to bring reproach upon their Savior and
                Lord; and, that separation from all religious apostasy, all worldly and sinful pleasures, practices and
                associations is commanded of God (II Timothy 3:1-5; Romans 12:1, 2, 14:13; I John 2:15-17; II John 9-11;
                II Corinthians 6:14-7:1).
            </p>
            <h2 class="big">Return of Christ</h2>
            <p class="big">
                We believe the “Blessed Hope” of our Lord’s return is literal, personal, visible, imminent, premillennial,
                and pretribulational. He will rapture His Church prior to the seven years of tribulation, and at the end 
                of the tribulation Christ will return with His saints to establish His thousand-year reign on the earth. 
                (I Thessalonians 4:13-18; Titus 2:13; I Thessalonians 1:10; Revelation 3:10; Zechariah 14:4-11; 
                Revelation 19:11-16, 20:1-6; Psalm 89:3-4)
            </p>
            <h2 class="big">Eternal State</h2>
            <p class="big">
                We believe in the bodily resurrection of all men, the saved to eternal life, and the unsaved to judgment
                and everlasting punishment (Matthew 25:46; John 5:28, 29, 11:25-26; Revelation 20:5-6, 12-13).
            </p>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that the souls of the redeemed are, at death, absent from the body and present with the Lord,
                where in conscious bliss they await the first resurrection, when spirit, soul, and body are reunited to
                be glorified forever with the Lord (Luke 23:43; Revelation 20:4-6; II Corinthians 5:8; Philippians 1:23,
                3:21; I Thessalonians 4:16-17).
            </p>
            <p class="big">
                We believe that the souls of unbelievers remain, after death, in conscious misery until the second resurrection,
                when with soul and body reunited they shall appear at the Great White Throne Judgment, and shall be cast into the
                Lake of Fire, not to be annihilated, but to suffer everlasting, conscious punishment (Luke 16:19-26; Matthew 25:41-46;
                II Thessalonians 1:7-9; Jude 6-7; Mark 9:43-48; Revelation 20:11-15).
